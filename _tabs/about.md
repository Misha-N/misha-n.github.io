# Hello everyone!

My name is Michal FrÃ½ba, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my blog. I'll be sharing my passion for **cyber security** and all things related to it. I'll be covering some interesting news in the industry, providing manuals, and introducing various tools. I would also like to focus on topics from **incident response**, **threat hunting**, and **pentesting**. Whether you're an expert in the field or just starting out, I hope you'll find valuable information and insights here.

Cyber security is a fascinating and constantly evolving field, and I'm excited to share my (let's be honest â€“ _not yet very extensive_ ðŸ˜…) knowledge with you.

In addition to cyber security, I'm also an avid traveler. I love exploring new places, trying new foods, and immersing myself in different cultures. I'll be sharing my tips and tricks for **budget traveling**, itineraries for various destinations, and other travel-related topics. I hope my travel articles will inspire you to go out and explore the world.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions for future articles. I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow cyber security enthusiasts and travel lovers alike!
